      <p>
        Dukkah, the Middle Eastern spice blend, comes in many forms. Recipes can feature countless combinations of seeds, nuts, spice, and herbs. This one hews closely to a version common in Egypt, which is often credited as the birthplace of dukkah. It's filled with roasted sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, cumin, and coriander seed, plus enough salt to make all the flavors pull together and pop. It can be used a million different ways. Try it sprinkled on soups, over roasted and grilled vegetables, topping fish and meat dishes, mixed with olive oil for a quick and easy dip, and more. Note that you can choose how finely to grind all of the ingredients; some people like a chunkier version, others like it finer, though it's rare to see dukkah that's crushed to the point of being completely powdery.

        Dukkah (pronounced DOO-kah) gets its name from the Egyptian Arabic word for "to crush" or "to pound," which is precisely how it's made. Recipes vary but generally consist of cumin, coriander, sesame seeds, salt, dried herbs, and nuts (especially peanuts, which are widely available in Egypt). The ingredients are put into a mortar (or, increasingly, a food processor) and ground into a coarse powder, releasing aromatics in the process. It's a versatile thing, both fine enough to sprinkle on as a garnish yet chunky enough to grab by the handful and eat as a snack, with a flavor profile that is specific to its place of origin yet thoroughly adaptable.

        Dukkah did first gain some traction beyond its home country after Claudia Roden published her mother's recipe in her 1968 cookbook A Book of Middle Eastern Food. But it has certainly had a moment of sorts, recently. Ana Sortun of Cambridge, MA's Oleana, has consistently included dukkah on the menu at her restaurant, serving it most recently as a dip with crudit√©s and a Moroccan-style almond butter called amalou. She also has plans to incorporate it into a power bar with tahini, in a riff on its sustaining qualities.
